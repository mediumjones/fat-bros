Fat Bros.
========

A fat-serifed display typeface.

This font was developed as an experiment to see what would happen if the ball terminals for an extra-black typeface were so oversized that they cut into the stems of the characters.

Fat Bros.ai - The finished character set (to date) converted to paths in an Adobe Illustrator CS6 file.

fatbros.otf - The finished OTF font file generated by fatbros.ufo in Robofont v1.4.

fatbros.ufo - The master UFO for making updates to the glyph set.

/specimens - Various type specimens created along the way to preview the typeface in use. (Specimens not be up to date with the latest version of the typeface)
